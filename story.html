<h1> koala:</h1>
   <p style="font-size:25px;"> Long ago my ancestor was a human boy and he drank up all the water in his clan.<br> He was so thirsty that he couldn't stop himself.<br> Everyone became angry at him and they banished mhim to the trees where he learned to drink from the eucalyptus leaves and became a Koala. <br> Here is a clue on where to find tadpole: 
       <br> What can’t walk but always runs,
<br> And is filled with germs a ton,
<br> I don’t know why tadpole resides there,
<br> But towards the library it can stare. </p>
